{quote: "Every lyric I ever wrote, I stand behind. There’s nothing ironic about it. I can remember deliberately not putting Ronald Reagan’s name in any song because I didn’t want it to be dated. I was singing about being a kid, and I thought that was universal. Because it was really about the transition from being a child in your nuclear family or your biological family to your new family, which is tribal quite often, through punk or whatever form. When I was writing those songs, I was thinking for real from my heart about those experiences, and I was thinking, ‘This is not specific to 1981 or 1980. This is something that people go through.’ I didn’t want to ruin it by talking about something that was nailed down to those particular years.",

{quote: "Yet you could feel a vibration in the air, a sense of hastening. It had started with the moon, inaccessible poem that it was. Now men had walked upon it, rubber treads on a pearl of the gods. Perhaps it was an awareness of time passing, the last summer of the decade. Sometimes I just wanted to raise my hands and stop. But stop what? Maybe just growing up.",

Don’t ever not be punk.’ Telling that to myself, I guess it was like self-defense against the scary world around me. Those initial feelings that really called to me have never gone away.",
